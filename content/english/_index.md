  - title: "Why ancient Greek students would outperform us in logic class"
    image: "/images/service-1.png"
    content: "Classical students were trained in grammar, logic, and rhetoric — the foundations of clear thinking. Modern kids are trained to skim, swipe, and switch. We bridge that gap."
    bulletpoints:
      - "Structured attention exercises inspired by classical pedagogy"
      - "Step-by-step reasoning drills kids genuinely enjoy"
      - "Reading sessions designed to build patience and endurance"
      - "Reflection-based writing to strengthen logical clarity"
      - "A modern adaptation of timeless cognitive training"

  - title: "Deep Reading: The lost superpower of Gen Alpha"
    image: "/images/service-2.png"
    content: "Deep reading strengthens comprehension, empathy, and analytical thinking — yet it’s rapidly disappearing. We help children rebuild this essential skill through guided, structured practice."
    bulletpoints:
      - "Attention-first reading method (not speed reading)"
      - "Guided close-reading techniques"
      - "Story summarization to enhance retention"
      - "Question-driven comprehension"
      - "Narrative reflection to build expressive thinking"

  - title: "It's not their fault — our world trains them to scroll, not read"
    image: "/images/service-3.png"
    content: "Parents aren’t failing. Children aren’t failing. The environment is overwhelming — everything is designed for instant dopamine. That’s why we create distraction-free sessions that retrain focus gently and effectively."
    bulletpoints:
      - "Device-level distraction blocking"
      - "Calm, one-to-one sessions with trained facilitators"
      - "Built-in attention recovery intervals"
      - "Stress-free pacing that matches each child’s cognitive readiness"
      - "Empathy-driven guidance to build confidence, not pressure"

    image: "/images/service-4.png"
    content: "Neuroscience is clear: attention grows with consistent, structured practice. Our method uses short, high-quality focus cycles that gradually expand a child’s capacity for deeper reading, writing, and listening."
    bulletpoints:
      - "Science-backed micro-focus sessions"
      - "Progressive load system (easy → moderate → deep)"
      - "Measurable attention growth over weeks"
      - "Reading, writing, and listening combined for whole-brain training"
      - "A method grounded in modern cognitive science"
